## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change for each step before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[] The vertical line in the slider should animate from the center
[] It currently says "Loading playlists" when the app opens until youtube music loads. But if we have cached playlists, show them immediately.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
[] Make an expanded playlist view
