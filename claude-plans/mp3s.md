## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] A hotkey to show the window
[] Sometimes on load is says "Sponsored" with 0:00
[] Make a native module for opening new windows.
[] Selecting a song in a non-playlist should switch to now playing
[] Have a menu item / hotkey to enable ytm view where it shows it to the right
[] Make an expanded playlist view
    [] Local files should display as a tree of artist / album
