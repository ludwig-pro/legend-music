## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- After each step is completed, check off the completed step in this file. Then do a git commit with a brief description of the change.
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] Use the settings$.general.playlistStyle setting to adjust how playlists look in Playlist.tsx. The existing look should be "Comfortable" mode. "Compact" mode should not display a thumbnail and should render everything on one line in the format `${number}. ${artist} - ${song}`

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Sometimes on load is says "Sponsored" with 0:00
[] Make a native module for opening new windows.
[] Selecting a song in a non-playlist should switch to now playing
[] Have a menu item / hotkey to enable ytm view where it shows it to the right
[] Make an expanded playlist view
    [] Local files should display as a tree of artist / album
