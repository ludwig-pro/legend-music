## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- After each step is completed, check off the completed step in this file. Then do a git commit with a brief description of the change.
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] When a youtube music playlist loads it should not update the playlist content if the local files playlist is selected
[x] If the Local Files playlist is selected on startup it should show the local files playlist

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Clicking song in playlist is not immediately playing the song. It opens the song correctly but I think it just needs to click the play button.

## Plan for even later (do not do these yet)

[] Make a native module for opening new windows.
[] Selecting a song in a non-playlist should switch to now playing
[] Have a menu item / hotkey to enable ytm view where it shows it to the right
[] Make an expanded playlist view
    [] Local files should display as a tree of artist / album
