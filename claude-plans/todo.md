## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- After each step is completed and before moving to the next step, check off the completed step in this file. Then do a git commit with a brief description of the changes in all chaged files, including the updated plan file.

## Steps

[] Something is asynchronous in the initial playlist loading. Find what it is and ask for confirmation before fixing it.
[] Click handling on a playlist should only work for left mouse button
[] A song with a - in the title is initially displaying as only the first part. I think it might be splitting on - incorrectly. The file I'm seeing handled incorrectly is in the m3u as "FleryCz - Mos Def - Do It Now"

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Clean up the directories in cache where files go. m3u should go in playlists
[] Allow user to select where m3u files go
[] Selecting a song in a non-playlist should switch to now playing
[] Need to make sure it's playing song not video
[] Sometimes on load is says "Sponsored" with 0:00
