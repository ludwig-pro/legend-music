- [x] Hotkeys are applying to all windows. For example pressing Cmd + A selects all in both the Playlist and MediaLibrary. I think we need to track which window is focused and use that for checking hotkeys.
- [] I should be able to double click an item in the left column of the MediaLibrary to add all of its tracks to the Playlist.
- [] When the currently playing song changes, if it is not in view then the scroller should scroll it into view.
